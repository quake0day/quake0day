### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Professor :neckbeard: in the Computer Science department at the West Chester University of Pennsylvania. I graduated from University at Buffalo - SUNY in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. [[Link](https://darlingtree.com/)]

My current research interests focus primarily on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with educational technologies to enhance personalized learning experiences and optimize instructional methodologies. Additionally, I am actively exploring novel approaches that combine voice transmission technologies with advanced AI models to improve speech-based human-computer interactions and communication systems.

Previously, my research has extensively covered innovative solutions in mobile sensing and smartphone-enabled crowdsourcing technologies, aiming at building cost-effective and scalable information infrastructures. My scholarly contributions have appeared in highly-regarded journals and conferences such as ACM SenSys, IEEE ICDCS, IEEE MASS, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (TMC), and IEEE IoT Journal. Notably, my paper on human voice detection technologies was awarded the Best Student Paper Award at the IEEE ICDCS conference in 2017.

I am an IEEE Senior Member and an active member of ACM.
